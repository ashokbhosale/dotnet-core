What is Microservices.

Microservices is an approach to develop small services that each run in its own process.
We should develop microservices instead of one service (a monolithic approach) for a multitude of benefits, including: Microservices are smaller in size.


NET Core Microservices. 
Microservices are an architectural style that promotes the development of complex applications as a suite of small services based on business capabilities.

Defination:-
"Microservices is a software architecture design pattern in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes communicating with each other using language-agnostic APIs. These services are small, highly decoupled and focus on doing a small task."
